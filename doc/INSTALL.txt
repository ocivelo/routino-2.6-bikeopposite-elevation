                           Routino : Installation
                           ======================


Quick Start Guide
-----------------

   The instructions below are a complete list of the minimum required to
   get Routino installed and running under Apache on Debian Linux (other
   Linux versions will be similar).

   ***********************************************************************
   *** These instructions should not be considered as complete or a    ***
   *** secure installation for the reasons given in more detail below. ***
   ***********************************************************************

   The starting point for the installation is in the Routino source code
   directory after it has been uncompressed. Most of the steps will need
   to be run as the root user.

   The first thing to do is to install the packages which are required for
   compilation of Routino as described in the Pre-Requisites section
   below.

        apt-get install gcc make libc6-dev libz-dev libbz2-dev

   After this the programs can be compiled:

        make

   The files for the web interface can now be copied to the web server
   directory. On Debian this is '/var/www' and the files changed to be
   owned by the user Apache runs as.

        cp -a web /var/www/routino
        chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/routino

   To be able to use Routino some data will need to be processed and a
   script is provided for this. This will download the data for the UK
   which may take a while and then process it.

        cd /var/www/routino/data
        sh -x create.sh

   The routino web pages also requires the OpenLayers Javascript to be
   downloaded and installed and a script is also provided for this.

        cd /var/www/routino/www/openlayers
        sh -x install.sh

   To make full use of the location search feature on the Routino web page
   you will need to install one extra perl package.

        apt-get install libjson-pp-perl

   Finally to make the web pages work you will need to add the extra lines
   to the Apache configuration file as described in the Configuration of
   Web Server section below.  You don't have to use 'vi' and can use any
   text editor.

        vi /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default
        apache2ctl restart

   Now everything should be set up and the web page should work if
   accessed at 'http://localhost/routino/www/routino/router.html'.

   When everything is working you should read the rest of this document
   carefully and make the following changes:
     * Download your choice of OSM data - edit the file data/create.sh and
       run it again.
     * Edit the www/routino/mapprops.js file to match the downloaded data
       and personal map preferences.
     * Move the files in the web server directory so that only the
       contents of the www directory are accessible by the web server.
     * Edit the file www/routino/paths.pl to reference the new file
       locations.


Pre-Requisites
--------------

   The programs are written in standard C language with minimal external
   requirements so only a small set of development tools are required
   (gcc, make). The compilation tools to use and the command line options
   are defined in the file 'Makefile.conf'.

   There is some support for multi-threading that uses pthreads and
   additional development libraries for this may be required. The
   multi-threading can be disabled at compile time if required by
   commenting out a couple of lines in the file 'Makefile.conf'.

   To use the built-in file decompression functions the zlib (or libz) and
   bzip2 (or libbz2) development libraries are also required. (On Linux
   systems these might be in packages called libz-dev and libbz2-dev). If
   these are not available the function be disabled by commenting out a
   couple of lines in the file 'Makefile.conf'.

   To use the web page interface an http server is required. Instructions
   below are for Apache but any server that supports CGIs should work.

   The web pages use the Perl scripting language and a number of the
   default Perl modules. To use the search function on the router web page
   the additional Perl module "JSON::PP" must be installed.


Compilation
-----------

   To compile the programs just type 'make' at the top level of the source
   tree.

   This program has been written to run on Linux, no cross-platform
   compatibility has been specifically included but on the other hand
   other platforms have not knowingly been excluded either.

   Any information on improving the compilation process on anything other
   than x86 Linux is welcome.


Installation
------------

   After compilation the executable files are copied into the directory
   web/bin and the default XML configuration files are copied into the
   directory web/data. This is in preparation for using the supplied
   example web pages but is also a useful location to copy the files from
   for normal use.

   The required executable files are 'planetsplitter', 'router' and
   'filedumper' and the '*-slim' versions of the same files. They can be
   copied to any location and need no special installation environment.
   The 'filedumperx' executable is for debugging and not required.

   The configuration files are called 'profiles.xml', 'tagging.xml' and
   'translations.xml'. The names of the configuration files can be
   specified on the command line but by default are also looked for in the
   directory that contains the routing database with these names.


Example Web Page
----------------

   The directory 'web' contains a set of files that can be used to create
   a working set of web pages with interfaces to the routing algorithm.

   The files in the 'web' directory will require copying to a location
   that is accessible by a web server. After copying the files some of
   them need to be edited; search through the files for lines that contain
   the words "EDIT THIS" and make appropriate edits. The files that need
   editing are 'paths.pl' (to set the directory paths) and 'mapprops.js' (to
   set the map properties).


Configuration of web files
--------------------------

   The assumption in this description is that the whole of the directory
   called web is copied into a directory that is accessible by an Apache
   web server.

    **************************************************************************
    **** This is not a secure configuration but an easy one to configure. ****
    **** Only the directory 'www' should be accessible by the web server. ****
    **** Do not use this configuration unmodified in a public web server. ****
    **************************************************************************

   The directory structure is as follows:

   web/
    |
    + /bin/                    <- The Routino executable files (when compiled).
    |
    + /data/                   <- The Routino database and default configuration
    |                             files.
    |
    + /results/                <- An empty directory to store the results.
    |
    + /www/                    <- The files that must be available to the web
        |                         server are below this level.
        |
        + /openlayers/         <- A directory to hold the OpenLayers scripts.
        |
        + /routino/            <- The main HTML, Javascript, CSS and CGI files.
            |
            + /documentation/  <- The HTML version of the Routino documentation.

   The directory 'bin' will be filled by running the compilation process.
   For a secure installation the 'bin' directory should be outside of the
   web server, the file 'www/routino/paths.pl' contains the path to the
   'bin' directory.

   The directory 'data' must contain the Routino database and is also the
   default location for the configuration files. The routing database is
   created by downloading the OSM files for the region of interest and
   running the 'planetsplitter' program. There is a script in the
   directory that will download the OSM files and create the required
   database. The script should be edited to set the names of the files to
   be downloaded.  For a secure installation the 'data' directory should
   be outside of the web server, the file 'www/routino/paths.pl' contains
   the path to the 'data' directory.

   The directory 'results' is a temporary directory that it used to hold
   the GPX and text files generated by the Routino router. The directory
   must be writable by the web server process since it is the CGI scripts
   that are run by the web server that writes the results here. For a
   secure installation the results directory should be outside of the web
   server, the file 'www/routino/paths.pl' contains the path to the
   results directory.

   The directory 'www' and its sub-directories are the only ones that need
   to be within the web server accessible directory.

   The directory 'www/openlayers' must be filled with the openlayers
   Javascript library that can be downloaded from
   http://www.openlayers.org/.  (This version of Routino has been tested
   with OpenLayers library versions 2.11 and 2.12). The files must be
   installed so that the file 'www/openlayers/OpenLayers.js' and the
   directories 'www/openlayers/img/', 'www/openlayers/theme/' all
   exist. There is a script in the directory that will automatically
   download the files, create an optimised "OpenLayers.js" and copy the
   files to the required locations.

   The directory 'www/routino' contains the main HTML, Javascript and CSS
   files as well as the CGI scripts that perform the server-side routing
   functions. The description below lists all of the files that contain
   editable information.

   paths.pl
          This contains the names of the directories that contain the
          executable files, router database and temporary results; the
          prefix for the routing database; and the names of the
          executables.

   mapprops.js
          The parameters in this file control the boundary of the visible
          map (defaults to UK), the minimum and maximum zoom levels
          (defaults to between 4 and 15 inclusive), the source of map
          tiles (defaults to the main OpenStreetMap tile server), the data
          editing and browsing URLs (default to the OpenStreetMap website)
          and the number of waypoints allowed (defaults to 9).

   The directory www/routino/documentation contains the HTML version of
   the Routino documentation.


Configuration of web server

   The file 'www/routino/.htaccess' contains all of the Apache
   configuration options that are required to get the example web pages
   running. The only problem is that because of the way that the
   "AllowOverride" option works one of the configuration options has been
   commented out. This must be enabled in the main Apache server
   configuration file.

   If you have copied the routino 'web' directory into '/var/www' and named
   it 'routino' then the entry that you need in your Apache configuration
   file is this one:
  
     <Directory /var/www/routino>
         AllowOverride All
         Options +ExecCGI
     </Directory>

   This can be placed anywhere between the <VirtualHost *:80> and
   </VirtualHost> tags which should be at the start and end of the file.
