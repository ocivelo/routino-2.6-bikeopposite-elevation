<h2><a name="H_1_1"></a>Quick Start Guide</h2>

The instructions below are a complete list of the minimum required to get
Routino installed and running under Apache on Debian Linux (other Linux versions
will be similar).

<p>

<em>These instructions should not be considered as complete or a secure
installation for the reasons given in more detail in
the <a href="H_1_5_1">Configuration of Web Files</a> section below.</em>

<p>

The starting point for the installation is in the Routino source code directory
after it has been uncompressed.  Most of the steps will need to be run as the
root user.

<p>
The first thing to do is to install the packages which are required for
compilation of Routino as described in the <a href="H_1_2">Pre-Requisites</a>
section below.

<pre class="boxed">
apt-get install gcc make libc6-dev libz-dev libbz2-dev
</pre>

After this the programs can be compiled:

<pre class="boxed">
make
</pre>

The files for the web interface can now be copied to the web server directory.
On Debian this is <tt>/var/www</tt> and the files changed to be owned by the
user Apache runs as.

<pre class="boxed">
cp -a web /var/www/routino
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/routino
</pre>

To be able to use Routino some data will need to be processed and a script is
provided for this.  This will download the data for the UK which may take a
while and then process it.

<pre class="boxed">
cd /var/www/routino/data
sh -x create.sh
</pre>

The routino web pages also requires the OpenLayers Javascript to be downloaded
and installed and a script is also provided for this.

<pre class="boxed">
cd /var/www/routino/www/openlayers
sh -x install.sh
</pre>

To make full use of the location search feature on the Routino web page you will
need to install one extra perl package.

<pre class="boxed">
apt-get install libjson-pp-perl
</pre>

Finally to make the web pages work you will need to add the extra lines to the
Apache configuration file as described in the <a href="H_1_5_2">Configuration of
Web Server</a> section below.  You don't have to use <tt>vi</tt> and can use any
text editor.

<pre class="boxed">
vi /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default
apache2ctl restart
</pre>

Now everything should be set up and the web page should work if accessed at
http://localhost/routino/www/routino/router.html.

<p>

When everything is working you should read the rest of this document carefully
and make the following changes:

<ul>
  <li>Download your choice of OSM data - edit the file <tt>data/create.sh</tt>
    and run it again.
  <li>Edit the <tt>www/routino/mapprops.js</tt> file to match the downloaded
    data and personal map preferences.
  <li>Move the files in the web server directory so that only the contents of
    the <tt>www</tt> directory are accessible by the web server.
  <li>Edit the file <tt>www/routino/paths.pl</tt> to reference the new file
    locations.
</ul>


<h2><a name="H_1_2"></a>Pre-Requisites</h2>

The programs are written in standard C language with minimal external
requirements so only a small set of development tools are required (gcc, make).
The compilation tools to use and the command line options are defined in the
file <tt>Makefile.conf</tt>.

<p>

There is some support for multi-threading that uses pthreads and additional
development libraries for this may be required.  The multi-threading can be
disabled at compile time if required by commenting out a couple of lines in the
file <tt>Makefile.conf</tt>.

<p>

To use the built-in file decompression functions the zlib (or libz) and bzip2
(or libbz2) development libraries are also required.  (On Linux systems these
might be in packages called libz-dev and libbz2-dev).  If these are not
available the function be disabled by commenting out a couple of lines in the
file <tt>Makefile.conf</tt>.

<p>

To use the web page interface an http server is required.  Instructions below
are for Apache but any server that supports CGIs should work.

<p>

The web pages use the Perl scripting language and a number of the default Perl
modules.  To use the search function on the router web page the additional Perl
module "JSON::PP" must be installed.


<h2><a name="H_1_3"></a>Compilation</h2>

To compile the programs just type <tt>make</tt> at the top level of the source
tree.

<p>

This program has been written to run on Linux, no cross-platform compatibility
has been specifically included but on the other hand other platforms have not
knowingly been excluded either.

<p>

Any information on improving the compilation process on anything other than x86
Linux is welcome.


<h2><a name="H_1_4"></a>Installation</h2>

After compilation the executable files are copied into the directory
<tt>web/bin</tt> and the default XML configuration files are copied into the
directory <tt>web/data</tt>.  This is in preparation for using the supplied
example web pages but is also a useful location to copy the files from for
normal use.

<p>

The required executable files are <tt>planetsplitter</tt>, <tt>router</tt> and
<tt>filedumper</tt> and the <tt>*-slim</tt> versions of the same files.  They
can be copied to any location and need no special installation environment.
The <tt>filedumperx</tt> executable is for debugging and not required.

<p>

The configuration files are called <tt>profiles.xml</tt>, <tt>tagging.xml</tt>
and <tt>translations.xml</tt>.  The names of the configuration files can be
specified on the command line but by default are also looked for in the
directory that contains the routing database with these names.


<h2><a name="H_1_5"></a>Example Web Page</h2>

The directory <tt>web</tt> contains a set of files that can be used to create a
working set of web pages with interfaces to the routing algorithm.

<p>

The files in the <tt>web</tt> directory will require copying to a location that
is accessible by a web server.  After copying the files some of them need to be
edited; search through the files for lines that contain the words "EDIT THIS"
and make appropriate edits (more details below).


<h3><a name="H_1_5_1"></a>Configuration of Web Files</h3>

The assumption in this description is that the whole of the directory called
<tt>web</tt> is copied into a directory that is accessible by an Apache web
server.

<p>

<em>This is not a secure configuration but an easy one to configure.</em>
<br>
<em>Only the directory <tt>www</tt> should be accessible by the web server.</em>
<em>Do not use this configuration unmodified in a public web server.</em>

<p>

The directory structure is as follows:

<pre>
   web/
    |
    + /bin/                    <- The Routino executable files (when compiled).
    |
    + /data/                   <- The Routino database and default configuration
    |                             files.
    |
    + /results/                <- An empty directory to store the results.
    |
    + /www/                    <- The files that must be available to the web
        |                         server are below this level.
        |
        + /openlayers/         <- A directory to hold the OpenLayers scripts.
        |
        + /routino/            <- The main HTML, Javascript, CSS and CGI files.
            |
            + /documentation/  <- The HTML version of the Routino documentation.
</pre>

The directory <tt>bin</tt> will be filled by running the compilation process.
For a secure installation the <tt>bin</tt> directory should be outside of the
web server, the file <tt>www/routino/paths.pl</tt> contains the path to
the <tt>bin</tt> directory.

<p>

The directory <tt>data</tt> must contain the Routino database and is also the
default location for the configuration files.  The routing database is created
by downloading the OSM files for the region of interest and running the
planetsplitter program.  There is a script in the directory that will download
the OSM files and create the required database.  The script should be edited to
set the names of the files to be downloaded.  For a secure installation
the <tt>data</tt> directory should be outside of the web server, the
file <tt>www/routino/paths.pl</tt> contains the path to the <tt>data</tt>
directory.

<p>

The directory <tt>results</tt> is a temporary directory that it used to hold the
GPX and text files generated by the Routino router.  The directory must be
writable by the web server process since it is the CGI scripts that are run by
the web server that writes the results here.  For a secure installation
the <tt>results</tt> directory should be outside of the web server, the file
<tt>www/routino/paths.pl</tt> contains the path to the <tt>results</tt> directory.

<p>

The directory <tt>www</tt> and its sub-directories are the only ones that need
to be within the web server accessible directory.

<p>

The directory <tt>www/openlayers</tt> must be filled with the openlayers
Javascript library that can be downloaded from http://www.openlayers.org/.
(This version of Routino has been tested with OpenLayers library versions 2.11
and 2.12).  The files must be installed so that the
file <tt>www/openlayers/OpenLayers.js</tt> and the
directories <tt>www/openlayers/img/</tt>, <tt>www/openlayers/theme/</tt> all
exist.  There is a script in the directory that will automatically download the
files, create an optimised "OpenLayers.js" and copy the files to the required
locations.

<p>

The directory <tt>www/routino</tt> contains the main HTML, Javascript and CSS
files as well as the CGI scripts that perform the server-side routing functions.
The description below lists all of the files that contain editable information.

<dl>
  <dt><tt>paths.pl</tt>
  <dd>This contains the names of the directories that contain the executable
      files, router database and temporary results; the prefix for the routing
      database; and the names of the executables.
  <dt><tt>mapprops.js</tt>
  <dd>The parameters in this file control the boundary of the visible map
      (defaults to UK), the minimum and maximum zoom levels (defaults to between
      4 and 15 inclusive), the source of map tiles (defaults to the main
      OpenStreetMap tile server), the data editing and browsing URLs (default
      to the OpenStreetMap website) and the number of waypoints allowed
      (defaults to 9).
</dl>

<p>

The directory <tt>www/routino/documentation</tt> contains the HTML version of
the Routino documentation.


<h3><a name="H_1_5_2"></a>Configuration of Web Server</h3>

The file <tt>www/routino/.htaccess</tt> contains all of the Apache configuration
options that are required to get the example web pages running.  The only
problem is that because of the way that the <tt>AllowOverride</tt> option works
one of the configuration options has been commented out.  This must be enabled
in the main Apache server configuration file.

<p>

If you have copied the routino <tt>web</tt> directory into <tt>/var/www</tt> and
named it <tt>routino</tt> then the entry that you need in your Apache
configuration file is this one:

<pre>
     &lt;Directory /var/www/routino&gt;
         AllowOverride All
         Options +ExecCGI
     &lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>

This can be placed anywhere between the <tt>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;</tt>
and <tt>&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</tt> tags which should be at the start and end of
the file.
